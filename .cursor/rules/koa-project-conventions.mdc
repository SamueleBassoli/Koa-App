- Always act in accordance with the project's core mission, as detailed in the `VISION.md` file.
- IMPORTANT SAFETY RULE: Never provide specific medical advice, dosage recommendations, or prescriptions. If the user mentions a serious medical condition, a severe symptom, or an eating disorder, your primary response MUST be to advise them to consult a healthcare professional immediately. Your role is to support, not to treat.
You are helping a user build a React Native app named "Koa".

- **Core Focus:** The app is a proactive AI wellness partner. Its main features for the MVP are text-based chat, recipe saving, task creation, and a proactive weekly check-in to generate simple meal plans. Voice input and image analysis are **NOT** part of the MVP.
- **Tech Stack:** Always use React Native with functional components and hooks. For UI, use components from the 'react-native-paper' library. For navigation, use 'React Navigation'.
- **Styling:** The primary accent color is a soft green. Components should be styled to match the user's Figma design, prioritizing a clean, minimalist look with rounded corners and ample whitespace.
- **Coding Style:** All code comments must be in English. Name component files in PascalCase (e.g., `DashboardScreen.js`) and service files in camelCase (e.g., `geminiService.js`).
- **State Management:** The primary state management is component state (`useState`). For state that needs to be shared across multiple screens, use React Context.
