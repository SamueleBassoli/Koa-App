description: Instructions for creating a service that uses local storage.

When creating a service that interacts with AsyncStorage:
- All data to be saved must be stringified using `JSON.stringify()`.
- All data retrieved must be parsed using `JSON.parse()`.
- All storage operations must be wrapped in `try...catch` blocks to handle potential errors, as storage can sometimes fail.
